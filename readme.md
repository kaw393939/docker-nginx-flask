# This lesson shows you how to use Oracale Free Cloud to host your Flask application with Godaddy domain using Docker and Nginx.

## [How To Video](https://youtu.be/P55EOyCFquc)


Notes:
1.  You will need to signup for [Oracle Free Tier](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) and will be charged $1 to activate the account.  
2.  You don't need a domain from Godaddy, it can come from anywhere, but I find [Godaddy](https://www.godaddy.com) is easy.  You can just use the IP address to access the server, if you don't have a domain.  When you buy a domain look for a discount code and don't buy more than one year, it will default to 3 years on Godaddy at checkout.
3.  You will need an SSH Public / Private Key pair.  [Windows Putty Instructions](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen) or [Linux / Mac Instructions](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-on-linux-unix/)
